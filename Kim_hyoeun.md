# Perdect Man

"Perdect Man" is a South Korean film directed by Lee Kwang-kuk, which tells the story of Jang-su (played by Seol Kyung-gu), a middle-aged man diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). As he gradually loses his physical abilities, Jang-su struggles with both his deteriorating body and his emotional turmoil. Despite the devastating nature of his disease, he finds small moments of joy, hope, and connection with the people around him. The film portrays the inner conflict of living with a terminal illness while trying to maintain some sense of dignity and human connection. It is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking exploration of life, loss, and the fragile nature of human existence.

In the film “Perfect Man”, the music used depicts the pain and hope experienced by the protagonist as he struggles with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a terminal disease. Composer Lee Dong-jun uses a melodic and emotional orchestral score to convey the physical deterioration and inner emotions of the character, Jang-su (played by Seol Kyung-gu). In particular, the harmony between piano and strings powerfully and subtly expresses his fear and despair, while also highlighting the fleeting moments of hope that emerge. The music strongly conveys the internal battle Jang-su faces against the disease and helps the audience emotionally connect with the physical suffering caused by ALS.
